\begin{abstract}
Quantization is an important technique in modern communication and data systems. Linear, non-linear, and vector quantization
implementations have different characteristics and implementation concerns. Quantifying the differences in performance 
and implementation complexity, we show some of the tradeoffs between each of these quantization methods.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{Q}{uantization} methods are crucial to modern technology. Quantization techniques have fueled 
advancements in communications, computing, and data processing. In this paper, we will compare linear and non-linear 
quantization methods at various bit levels, and discuss the complexities associated with each technique.

\subsection{Background}
Conveying information with minimal data has been and continues to be an important part of technology and research. Passwords, 
military codes, cellular communications, and compression are either in whole or in part based on this concept. One of the simplest ways
to achieve data reduction is to eliminate data that does not transmit useful information. This elimination, done correctly, can 
greatly reduce the amount of data required to transmit information, such as words in a conversation.

\subsection{Overview}
Several different methods of quantization will be shown and compared in the following pages. Implementations of linear, 
$\mu$-law, and vector quantizers were run against different audio files, generating results for mean squared error and 
signal to noise ratio. We also take special care to discuss the implementation details of each quantization type.

\subsection{Goal}
Our goal in this paper is to identify different ways to perform quantization, compare the performance of each method discussed, show 
implementation examples for each, and discuss the engineering trade-offs associated with choosing a particular quantization scheme.

\section{Error}
Quantization is considered a "lossy" scheme, which means that during the quantization operation, data is thrown out and cannot
be recovered. This data may or may not contain useful information about the signal being quantized. When data is lost, error is
introduced, known as quantization error. Given a sampled input $x_n$, quantization error can be shown as \cite{DSPBook}
\begin{equation}
x_q = x_n + e_n
\end{equation}
where $e_n$ is the quantization error. Quantizer performance will be measured by comparing the error introduced by different methods
while holding system inputs and parameters fixed. Two basic measurements convey the amount of error introduced, Mean Squared Error (MSE)
and SNR (Signal To Noise Ratio).

\section{Linear Quantization}
\subsection{Formulation}
Linear quantization is the simplest method for aplying quantization to a signal. The linear quantizer can be implemented as a sample
and hold operation in hardware, or by the integer division method available in most computer languages. For an input sample $x_n$, the
linear quantizer can be formulated as follows \cite{DSPBook}
\begin{equation}
    x_q = int(\frac{x_n}{\alpha}) 
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{x_{max} - x_{min}}{2^B}
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the number of quantization bits.

\subsection{Performance}
The linear quantizer has near-zero computational overhead, and with a relatively large number of quantization bits or a narrow 
dynamic range, quantization error can be fairly low. However, the linear quantizer is a poor choice for many systems, as there are
alternatives which introduce less quantization error for the same system parameters $x_{max}$, $x_{min}$, and $B$.
